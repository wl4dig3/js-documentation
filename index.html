              JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting
              language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host
              environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be
              connected to the objects of its environment to provide
              programmatic control over them.
            </p>
            <p>
              JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
              Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
              operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
              be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
              additional objects; for example:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model
                (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application
                to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events
                such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
              </li>
              <li>
                Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
                server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with
                a database, provide continuity of information from one
                invocation to another of the application, or perform file
                manipulations on a server.
              </li>
